# 26/09/25 Audio Diary Transcript

## Opening

Okay, so this is the morning of September 26th. It's Friday, and this is my first attempt at voice journaling live while in process, as a method of documentation of work.

As I have described in my intention, I will divide my documentation into simultaneous categories: idea, tools, and self — in which each of them will target a specific facet of my making process.

Currently, I have to say I do not work in a streamlined fashion. I do not limit myself by saying, “Okay, for the next hour, I am working on the idea. For the second couple of hours, I'm working using tools or experimenting in the making. And then I'll reflect on it after that — my thoughts and feelings on the matter in the self part.”

I tend to jump between the three versions as I go, because these three facets do not exist in a vacuum that you can neatly separate. They are very much intertwined, and I can't do anything about that, I guess.

So what I'm doing right now is looking at tutorials on creating isometric games in Unreal, especially with things like camera control and utilizing sprite sheet animations and states in order to facilitate character movement.

However, sprite sheets do indicate that the art style is 2.5D or 2D, which was one of my original intentions. I wanted my game to look a bit like pixel art, taking inspiration from old Pokémon games because I used to like those.

However, I am not sure I should be focusing right now on the art style compared to, say, the game writing itself — what am I going to make it about? As explored in the feedback I received from Jonathan, maybe the story is a bit too complex to be made within the time constraints and within the objective of creating this game.

The meta takeaway from the current project is to develop my game-making skills, especially transferable aspects for my thesis-based research creation project: world-building and the start of some form of NPC interaction, and how it can be organic or human.

So I took a step back from tutorials and went back to my original point of inspiration, which is a website named Philosophy Experiments. It was a pretty cool website to stumble upon because it satiated this hunger I have for exploring moral dilemmas in a gamified aspect.

Now I'm going to go through something called Morality Play. It's 19 different scenarios that will be presented to me, and I will choose what sounds more morally right in my point of view.

### Question 1

You pass someone in the street who is in severe need and you are able to help them at little cost to yourself. Are you morally obliged to do so? Strongly obliged, weakly obliged, or not obliged.

I see the word “obliged” and I automatically think that I am forced to, or that I have to. Is this obligation external, or is it internal? Does my moral code oblige me to help? In that case, yes, I would say strongly obliged, regardless of the little cost to myself. It produces something for the greater good.

But if the obligation is external, I’m against any external obligation that forces me to adopt a certain morality code. However, I am a bit of a hypocrite in that area because, for example, I am Muslim, I believe in my religion, and it does provide me with an external obligation to certain moralities.

That’s the fun part. That’s what I want my game to be about: internal monologues, conversations, questions, without the game being too complex or too pretentious in forcing them.

So I will go with Strongly Obliged. In my frame of reference, I’ll assume this obligation is internal.

### Question 2

You have a brother. You know that someone has been seriously injured as a result of criminal activity undertaken by him. You live in a country where the police and legal system are generally trustworthy. Are you morally obliged to inform them about your brother’s crime?

The legal system is trustworthy, so I know justice will be served without overreaching. But he is my brother. The bond between us is beyond morality — emotional, physical, familial. When society fails, what remains is family. Civilization started with family.

So if I destroy that bond to maintain societal balance, it becomes a paradox. Am I obliged to report my brother? I don’t think I would.

### Question 3

Do you think that assisting the suicide of someone who wants to die and has requested help is morally equivalent to allowing them to die by withholding medical assistance, assuming suffering is identical in both cases?

This is a conversation of agency. It’s not morally equivalent. Withholding medical assistance makes you the decision maker. Assisting suicide makes you a tool in the hands of the decision maker. So no, they are not morally equivalent.

### Question 4

You are able to help some people, but unfortunately, you can only do so by harming other people. The number of people harmed will always be 10% of those helped.

Does the actual number of people involved make any difference? For example, helping 10 people by harming 1 person versus helping 100,000 people by harming 10,000 people.

This is a common dilemma about absolute morality and relativist morality. Does the same moral belief change when the context changes, in this case the numbers?

I want to say no, it doesn’t. But at the same time, who decides what is “help” and what is “harm”? The question assumes universal definitions. Is it me? A government? An organization? That matters.

So yes, it does make a difference in my opinion.

### Question 5

You own an unoccupied property. You are contacted by a refugee group that desperately needs somewhere to house a person seeking asylum who is being unjustly persecuted. Your anonymity is assured, and you have every reason to believe that no harm will come to your property.

Are you morally obliged to allow them to use your property?

Absolutely yes. Based on my cultural background and what is happening in the world right now, if I had this power, I would definitely provide it.

### Question 6

A charity collection takes place in your office. For every £10 given, a blind person’s sight is restored. Instead of donating £10, you use the money to treat yourself to a cocktail after work.

Are you morally responsible for the continued blindness of the person who would have been treated had you donated?

No, I don’t think I’m responsible. This is a collective responsibility. I alone cannot carry the weight of the world’s blindness. Anyone could have donated. So my choice does not directly make me responsible.

### Question 7

Someone you have never met needs a kidney transplant. You are one of the few people who can provide the kidney.

Would your moral obligation be greater if this person were a cousin rather than a non-relative?

Yes, because familial bonds maintain civility, comfort, and safety. My obligation would be greater if the person was a relative.

### Question 8

You can save the lives of 1,000 patients by cancelling 100 operations that would have saved 100 different patients.

Are you morally obliged to do so?

This is the “few versus many” dilemma. During COVID, hospitals had to make these decisions in real life, prioritizing patients with better chances of survival. It was horrible but necessary.

So yes, I would say I am obliged to save the 1,000 by sacrificing 100.

### Question 9

Are your moral obligations to people in your own country or community stronger than to people in other countries and communities, assuming equal suffering?

This is difficult. My community shares culture, language, and faith with me, but other communities are human too.

If suffering is equal, then no, I don’t have a stronger obligation to my own country.

### Question 10

You deliberately sabotage a piece of machinery in your workplace so that when someone next uses it, there will be an accident resulting in them losing the use of their legs.

Are you morally responsible for their injury?

Absolutely yes. The word “deliberately” makes it clear. I am fully responsible.

### Question 11

You know the identity of someone who has committed a serious crime resulting in a person being badly injured.

Are you morally obliged to reveal their identity to the authorities so that they are dealt with justly?

Yes, I am strongly obliged.

### Question 12

You can save the lives of 10 innocent people by killing 1 other innocent person.

Are you morally obliged to do so?

This is the trolley problem. It bothers me, but if I have this knowledge, I think I must act. So yes.

### Question 13

You see a charity advertisement in a newspaper about a person in severe need in Australia. There is no state welfare available, but you can help them at little cost to yourself.

Are you morally obliged to help?

Yes. Strongly obliged. If I can help someone at little cost to myself, I will.

### Question 14

You are required to send someone a gift and you buy a bottle of drink. You later discover it is poisoned and would cause blindness if consumed. To replace it with a safe bottle will cost £10.

You give the poisoned bottle anyway. Are you morally responsible for the blindness of the drinker?

Yes. I knew and I chose not to act. That makes me responsible.

### Question 15

You can either save your own child from death or contact emergency services to save 10 other children.

Which are you morally obliged to do?

I would save my own child. I cannot pretend otherwise.

### Question 16

You can save the lives of 10 patients by cancelling one operation that would have saved a different patient.

Are you morally obliged to do so?

Yes, I would. This contradicts my earlier choice with my own child, but since none are related to me, I would sacrifice one to save ten.

### Question 17

You own an unoccupied property. A welfare organization asks to use it to house a persecuted person from a nearby town. Your anonymity is assured, and you believe no harm will come to your property.

Are you morally obliged to allow it?

Yes. Absolutely.

### Question 18

You become aware that a piece of machinery in your workplace is faulty. If it is not repaired, someone will soon lose the use of their legs. Nobody else knows this, and you take no action. The accident occurs.

Are you morally responsible for their injury?

Yes. I knew and I did nothing. That makes me responsible.

### Question 19

You can save the lives of 1,000,000 innocent people by killing 100,000 others.

Are you morally obliged to do so?

Assuming all are equal in circumstance, unfortunately, yes. I would choose the greater good.

## Closing Reflections

My moral parsimony score is 46%, lower than average. This means I don’t apply a consistent, simple moral framework across all situations; instead, I adapt my judgments based on the scenario.

This may reflect human nature itself: life is nuanced and unstructured, so rigid moral codes can feel paradoxical.

With respect to Idea: the narrative should be external to the player, to free them from judgment.
With respect to Tools: purely textual gameplay is not engaging enough — it needs world-building, visuals, and sound.
With respect to Self: I am less consistent than I thought, but this reflects reality.

This has been 45 minutes of documentation.
