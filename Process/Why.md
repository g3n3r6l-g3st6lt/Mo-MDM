# Intentions
The aim of my participation in Materializing Design is three-fold:
1- To develop a game prototype as a method to enter the game making "domain" and evolve various relevant skills in space that encourages analysis, reflection, and iterations.

2- To approach game-making from a design and authorship perspectives, championing process and methods over an product-oriented enclosed path.

3- Connect the continuous victories and failures in the process of game-making through 3 pillars: **(i)**_"Idea"_ which explores the development of the game concept, the reasoning behind choices related to game-writing, world-building, game logic, etc; **(ii)**_"Tools"_ which will focus on the technical creation aspect of the game and analyzing my workflows, documenting my approaches and outputs; and **(iii)**_"Self"_ which will target my personal thought process and emotions during the process, trying to conciously analyze my decision-making triggers, my fears, and my identity/background influences on the process.
