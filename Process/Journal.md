**Theme:** Cerebral, personal, collaborative narrative. Based on moral parsimony and dilemmas. Play as detective, whose personality is shaped through player's choices.

**Premise:** You are a detective in a world where reasoning through weighing moral and logical categories defines the course of action (and sometimes, verdict) of each investigation. That means admitting and analyzing evidence, suspect interrogation, arrests, and charges depend on the detective’s ideas of morality, logic, good/evil, and intent. The detective will also have to use the evidence collected, information gained from NPC interaction, and their internal negotiation with their logical and moral compass to convince their higher-ups of their verdict.

**Genre:** Detective Noir Semi-linear RPG.

The tools I aim to use are **Unreal Engine**, **Blender3D**, **Adobe Photoshop**, and **Adobe Illustrator** + **Sublime Text** for possible/potential code editing for Unreal.

I am equally excited and afraid. Leaving a secure and comforting zone of doing something I know to throw myself into a world I only viewed from an adjacent distance with wonder is not easy. Being a student again, facing my inner failures, and wanting this to work are my first steps to gain assurance that I am in the right place and I can do what i intend to do in the grand scheme of things. I am comfortable with some tools, I am comfortable with research, and I am especially attached to the subject of moral frameworks and the volatility of what is good in the face of human experiences.

### 23/09/2025 - Per discussion with Jonathan Lessard (mentor and supervisor)

Detective stories are extremely complex to gamify.

Games don’t need to have a story/dramatic structure (revisit embedded vs. emergent narratives in games).

Focus on building a game that teaches me concepts/mechanics transferable to my research-creation PhD project.

Test game logic through using pen and paper/textual simulation of mechanics and levels.

I think the isometric setting still holds water.\

I want to still pursue the core concept of exploring moral frames of reference, perhaps a simpler narrative?

My focus now will be on world-building philosophies for adventure games + technical research on isometric game-making on Unreal.

A detective noir narrative meets moral dilemmas is a match made in heaven, the nature of moral frameworks tested through one of the extreme of alchemies of human experience aka crime is very convenient; however, I have limited time (logically self-imposed) to produce a prototype of this project. Building an intricate embedded narrative that branches into tens or even hundreds of pathways that lead to multiple endings is a bit over-the-top. Can my good enemy Chat-GPT help me with that? But I have a problem with using Chat-GPT, I feel it is cheating, but I only want it to augment my own idea with more efficient formulations. I don’t know, will test.

Watching tutorials on creating hand-drawn (analog or digital) isometric perspective elements was visually inspiring, however, my illustration skills are not formidable enough to build a consistent style and an efficient pipeline to produce assets for my game. I find it more reliable and comfortable to use Blender and Adobe Illustrator for this part. Why not try to create hand-drawn assets though? Time constraints and skill threshold. I will create simple apartment building to test.

I am very slow with my work and documentation, I am seeking immediate gratification through watching tutorials and reading articles as if that is work. But what if that work (per discussion on MDM Discord).

“Work” is any conscious activity that leads to intentional or unintentional synthesis of ideas, strategies, and analysis of making. I know that the moment I start sketching those assets I will get in a flow state and get it done, sometimes I’d produce too much to feel that my time has been well-spent.

Why did I choose moral dilemmas and detective story? Is it my fascination with morality and its frameworks? Or is it my desire to create adventures that resonate with players? On a more personal note, maybe I am a maximalist who only sees value and effort if I shove as much profundity and complexity into a project? Maybe that played a part in why I have rarely completed anything.

Why am I interested in the player being a detective? Is it the sense of security in working for a government institution that enforces laws, hence applies a clearcut (very questionable) representation of “justice”?

Do I want the player to have the authority to decide the fate of the world and NPCs? Or Do I want the player to suffer the consequences themself?

Why noir? Due to the stylistic and thematic sensations and aesthetics of intrigue, mystery, cinema twists?

Why so serious? (Hahaha.) No, seriously, why does it always have to be dark and gritty?

If I target simpler and more nuanced horizons, then something fun like Cards Against Humanity, Scruples, Cyanide and Happiness: Trial by Trolley. However fun these are, I just don’t think they are my flavor or potential similar signature for me as a designer. Yes, they have wonderful mechanics and are extremely fun, but they depend heavily on multiplayer engagement and socializing. I do not want a game that forces a player into that setting just yet.

I need to research specific plugins and pipelines to facilitate isometric game making on Unreal, especially camera controls and world-generation.

I installed PaperZD plugin for Unreal via Fab. It should facilitate my 2D game design.

I target a sense of moral goodness that is very straightforward because I struggle with my own experience of good and evil, and how these concepts got muddled very early in my life and keep confusing me. I want structure, and I am projecting that through a simple, albeit false dichotomy.

I target a sense of social authority via being a detective because it gives me this sensation of isolation of consequences from my personal life while being a “force for justice” (idealistic and very unrealistic).

I target dark and gritty setting because I do not think I can synthesize light worlds or scenarios, my mind is consumed by melodramatic interpretations of lived experiences. I think I derive my sense of agency and creativity from a dark place.

I think I need to go simpler, go for fun but also thoughtful, simple but nuanced. I need to clear a lot of clutter.

Why separate the narrative and the technical? Why not make them one and the same! Instead of the complexity and nuances of detective stories and role-playing, maybe the path is to visualize moral parsimony as a puzzle/labyrinth/strategy exchange between the player and the world. This will require some bbrief research into visualizing abstracts and puzzle-making, but I currently think that this format is the best vessel to hit both of my targets into an experience.

I have sunk into a world of algorithms and generative content, I don't want the game to lose the plot and revel in its own complexity. I do not want the game to lean into a purely skill-oriented labyrinth solver. I want the world to reflect the process of moral engagement with a situation/dilemma; where the active navigation and traversal within that world simulated such thought process. Is that too complicated? How can it be simpler?

## Tools log \# 4

### 03/10/2025

I need to find a tool(s) and method(s) to efficiently build and test labyrinth designs that reflect investigated representations of moral parsimony.
How did I not consider to simply use pen and paper?

I think I understand Jonathan lessard's discussion with me when he understood my tendency to want to involve storytelling and separate it from the technical process due to my background in screen media with affinities to film. Merging the form and ethos into a unified experience is something I am excited about, but I fear the complex mathematical and computational avenues I am opening by entertaining the pozzibility of mazes/labyrinths. I always tend to solve a complexity with another, trading one poison for another.

I think I can simplify my idea further, maybe I need to stand back and think like a player for a moment. Quantic Foundry's _Game Motivation Model_ provides some insight into why a poetic puzzle game can be inticing to play, but it has to balance the poetry with skill-mastery to achieve my intentions (or maybe it will turn out that my intention will face a change?).
