**Theme:** Cerebral, personal, collaborative narrative. Based on moral parsimony and dilemmas. Play as detective, whose personality is shaped through player's choices.

**Premise:** You are a detective in a world where reasoning through weighing moral and logical categories defines the course of action (and sometimes, verdict) of each investigation. That means admitting and analyzing evidence, suspect interrogation, arrests, and charges depend on the detective’s ideas of morality, logic, good/evil, and intent. The detective will also have to use the evidence collected, information gained from NPC interaction, and their internal negotiation with their logical and moral compass to convince their higher-ups of their verdict.

**Genre:** Detective Noir Semi-linear RPG.

I am equally excited and afraid. Leaving a secure and comforting zone of doing something I know to throw myself into a world I only viewed from an adjacent distance with wonder is not easy. Being a student again, facing my inner failures, and wanting this to work are my first steps to gain assurance that I am in the right place and I can do what i intend to do in the grand scheme of things. I am comfortable with some tools, I am comfortable with research, and I am especially attached to the subject of moral frameworks and the volatility of what is good in the face of human experiences.

### 23/09/2025 - Per discussion with Jonathan Lessard (mentor and supervisor)

Detective stories are extremely complex to gamify.

Games don’t need to have a story/dramatic structure (revisit embedded vs. emergent narratives in games).

Focus on building a game that teaches me concepts/mechanics transferable to my research-creation PhD project.

Test game logic through using pen and paper/textual simulation of mechanics and levels.

I think the isometric setting still holds water.\

I want to still pursue the core concept of exploring moral frames of reference, perhaps a simpler narrative?

My focus now will be on world-building philosophies for adventure games + technical research on isometric game-making on Unreal.

A detective noir narrative meets moral dilemmas is a match made in heaven, the nature of moral frameworks tested through one of the extreme of alchemies of human experience aka crime is very convenient; however, I have limited time (logically self-imposed) to produce a prototype of this project. Building an intricate embedded narrative that branches into tens or even hundreds of pathways that lead to multiple endings is a bit over-the-top. Can my good enemy Chat-GPT help me with that? But I have a problem with using Chat-GPT, I feel it is cheating, but I only want it to augment my own idea with more efficient formulations. I don’t know, will test.

Watching tutorials on creating hand-drawn (analog or digital) isometric perspective elements was visually inspiring, however, my illustration skills are not formidable enough to build a consistent style and an efficient pipeline to produce assets for my game. I find it more reliable and comfortable to use Blender and Adobe Illustrator for this part. Why not try to create hand-drawn assets though? Time constraints and skill threshold. I will create simple apartment building to test.

I am very slow with my work and documentation, I am seeking immediate gratification through watching tutorials and reading articles as if that is work. But what if that work (per discussion on MDM Discord).

“Work” is any conscious activity that leads to intentional or unintentional synthesis of ideas, strategies, and analysis of making. I know that the moment I start sketching those assets I will get in a flow state and get it done, sometimes I’d produce too much to feel that my time has been well-spent.

Why did I choose moral dilemmas and detective story? Is it my fascination with morality and its frameworks? Or is it my desire to create adventures that resonate with players? On a more personal note, maybe I am a maximalist who only sees value and effort if I shove as much profundity and complexity into a project? Maybe that played a part in why I have rarely completed anything.

### 30/09/2025

Why am I interested in the player being a detective? Is it the sense of security in working for a government institution that enforces laws, hence applies a clearcut (very questionable) representation of “justice”?

Do I want the player to have the authority to decide the fate of the world and NPCs? Or Do I want the player to suffer the consequences themself?

Why noir? Due to the stylistic and thematic sensations and aesthetics of intrigue, mystery, cinema twists?

Why so serious? (Hahaha.) No, seriously, why does it always have to be dark and gritty?

If I target simpler and more nuanced horizons, then something fun like Cards Against Humanity, Scruples, Cyanide and Happiness: Trial by Trolley. However fun these are, I just don’t think they are my flavor or potential similar signature for me as a designer. Yes, they have wonderful mechanics and are extremely fun, but they depend heavily on multiplayer engagement and socializing. I do not want a game that forces a player into that setting just yet.

I need to research specific plugins and pipelines to facilitate isometric game making on Unreal, especially camera controls and world-generation.

I installed PaperZD plugin for Unreal via Fab. It should facilitate my 2D game design.

## Self log \# 3

### 30/09/2025

I target a sense of moral goodness that is very straightforward because I struggle with my own experience of good and evil, and how these concepts got muddled very early in my life and keep confusing me. I want structure, and I am projecting that through a simple, albeit false dichotomy.

I target a sense of social authority via being a detective because it gives me this sensation of isolation of consequences from my personal life while being a “force for justice” (idealistic and very unrealistic).

I target dark and gritty setting because I do not think I can synthesize light worlds or scenarios, my mind is consumed by melodramatic interpretations of lived experiences. I think I derive my sense of agency and creativity from a dark place.

I think I need to go simpler, go for fun but also thoughtful, simple but nuanced. I need to clear a lot of clutter.

Why separate the narrative and the technical? Why not make them one and the same! Instead of the complexity and nuances of detective stories and role-playing, maybe the path is to visualize moral parsimony as a puzzle/labyrinth/strategy exchange between the player and the world. This will require some bbrief research into visualizing abstracts and puzzle-making, but I currently think that this format is the best vessel to hit both of my targets into an experience.

I have sunk into a world of algorithms and generative content, I don't want the game to lose the plot and revel in its own complexity. I do not want the game to lean into a purely skill-oriented labyrinth solver. I want the world to reflect the process of moral engagement with a situation/dilemma; where the active navigation and traversal within that world simulated such thought process. Is that too complicated? How can it be simpler?

**QUICK THOUGHT** Maze-like levels with multiple ways of navigating it to reach multiple eventualities. There are ways to "cheat" or break the rigid structure of the maze to traverse faster or collect more (collectibles?) at the cost of being scored less because you didn't commit to winning through the structure and rules of the maze. This is a very simplistic view of moral parsimony, except the winning and losing are not really a thing in moral parsimony since it is a very subjective concept. I try to represent the absence of right/wrong choice here with respect to the preference to collect more and score less, or collect less and score more. But separating score evaluation from collectibles, and punishing creative or efficient traversal of a maze does not represent my intentions. I need more balanced incentives, and I need to represent the subjectivity of moral approaches better.

I need to find a tool(s) and method(s) to efficiently build and test labyrinth designs that reflect investigated representations of moral parsimony.
How did I not consider to simply use pen and paper?

This is a very cool tool to test different shapes of top-down  2D mazes, with control over building algorithm, randomness, complexity, shape, and solves: https://codebox.net/pages/maze-generator/online 

I could potentially use this as a general guide and meditation over traversing a puzzle world (and enjoy playing a maze or two).

### 03/10/2025

I think I understand Jonathan lessard's discussion with me when he understood my tendency to want to involve storytelling and separate it from the technical process due to my background in screen media with affinities to film. Merging the form and ethos into a unified experience is something I am excited about, but I fear the complex mathematical and computational avenues I am opening by entertaining the pozzibility of mazes/labyrinths. I always tend to solve a complexity with another, trading one poison for another.

I think I can simplify my idea further, maybe I need to stand back and think like a player for a moment. Quantic Foundry's _Game Motivation Model_ provides some insight into why a poetic puzzle game can be inticing to play, but it has to balance the poetry with skill-mastery to achieve my intentions (or maybe it will turn out that my intention will face a change?).

### 05/10/2025

I am still conducting research about visualizing abstracts, maze-building, and gamifiying dilemmas (see /Bibliography section in /Process). My intention is to find symbolic methods that can still represent my intentions without making it too complex, pretentious, or veer from its path as a small game.

I am trying to consolidate the nuances of moral judgement into simple active decisions, which isn't necessarily the most reflective of the depth of moral parsimony, but I have no obligation to be objective or holistic. I HAVE to separate between data I acquire through research, and what gets distilled into output. So I intend to make collectibles, make some parts of the mazes destructible; I hope these mechanics allow for active decision-making which reveals metaphorically moral decisions. Again, this is an over-simplification of moral nuances, but the game "explores" a world-building analogy, it does not provide a dissertation on moral frameworks.

I have started to produce some basic character art and animation, and it feels great to create! The intention of this current iteration of character creation is to use my own likeness to produce a simple character with 3 basic animations: walking, acquiring collectible/consumable, and an attack. (the game won't need many character animations). I am exploring two workflows: The first depends greatly on gen-AI via asset creation and animation on *Pixel Lab*; it so far requires a lot of manual refinement and iterations to get consistent results. It is also limited to pixel-art (it's in the name), which I do not mind since this is the artstyle I am going with. The second mostly manual through modelling and texturing a 3D, lowpoly character following this visualization: https://tohawork.com/en/zeromodelling using Blender, then *Mixamo* for base animations.

The reason why I am using *Blender* and not creating my manual character directly in 2D pixel style on another software boils down to my technical skill and efficiency.

(see /Art section in /Process for game art updates).

I have not discussed the past couple of updates with Jonathan yet, but I do think I need to focus and commit to a certain path for a bit to discuss its merits with a form of experimental experience.

I feel good creating some "product" beyond reflections and readings; I measure progress in creation and not in the accumalated knowledge I am acquiring. However, I feel that I am pushing the time of executing a build as much as possible because I fear the technical elements of this process that I am new to, I fear that the game may end up being empty, phony and a waste of digital signature.

I need to push myself to dive into this sense of failure and work on my process through it. Fear stems from the unknown, and if I know there will be failures, then why fear failure?

I am adamant on following the maze-runner format now for a full test-run (pun not intended). I find there is potential in its concept, mechanics, and replayability. However, there are some questions I must negotiate with to refine the experience. Part of these negotiations can be made significantly simpler and fruitful through player-testing, hence the need to commit to a build. These questions include: 

**(1)** What is the driving action to engage with the game? (hook)

**(2)** What does the player have to give from their personal experience, skill, and identity? (cost)

**(3)** What form of gratification, knowledge, or promise does the game hold upon experiencing and/or completion? (reward)

**(4)** In the more specific case of exploring moral parsimony through a maze that may have different escapes and different routes/methods of traversal, how can the player be enticed to make an active choice among them or to consider the different outcomes without a constant obvious standout?

I need to read more into mazes and game logic.

Pixel Lab is amazing for my character creation and animation, but God is it absolutely painful in how many iterations it takes for some specific orientations to be consistent with others. So it produces characters almost perfect to their prompts, and its catalogue of animations are adequately inclusive, but the way it translates an animation to the character loses its reliability relative to the direction of the animation render. The incosistency manifests in the form of jumbled anatomy, addition or omission of character's visual details, and/or movement speed and range being inconsistent with the other directions/orientations for the same movement. This results in the need to repeat the generation tens of times for one (or more) orientation so it matches the rest. The main issue is that all 8 directions/orientations have to be consistent for the animation to be usable, one wrong/flawed orientation renders the whole animation useless.

Engaging with both ideation and making simultaneously is fun and efficient, but very draining. I feel I am actually being "productive", albeit for short bursts rather than a slow-burn. I have made peace with how I view my productivity and valuation of a process' quaity. I am restless and want to produce any semblance of a level build to assure Jonathan I am actually doing some work and not just faffing about. I am starting to appreciate ideation simplicity and narrowing down grand, explosive concepts for thoughtful and refined ones. I like audiovisual journaling, and I think I will engage with it more as I "produce" more.

### 09/10/2025

I have been exploring visual representation and art style as I am testing my character creation flow via Pixel Lab, and it occured to me, how about going a step further in the metaphor of abstracts, illusions, paradoxes and identity through choosing René Magritte's "Son of Man" to be the playable character. The identity of the character is irrelevant, the character has an iconic look which adds some intrigue and appeal, and what he represents being hidden by the visible while from his perspective the visible also blinds him. To challenge visual certainty and treachery of images plays into the moral ambiguity, relativity, and parsimony. Will investigate further in tools.

The consistency issue arises again in Pixel Lab, however, now I have a character with distinct features and a visual reference to derive it from. Which will make my alternative manual flow via Blender significantly easier and modular (apple, overcoat, bowling hatm etc). I am almost complete with an 8-direction walking cycle for a first iteration of Son of Man (SOM) character (will post in /Process/Art). The next step would be to import the sprites into Unreal Engine and using Paper2D/ZD plugin to sort out sprite allocation and movement controls (will post experiment in /Process/Audiovisual_Diary).
