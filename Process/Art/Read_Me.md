This section documents Game Art iterations, tools, and process.

The goal is to explore, compare, and crystalize best practices for my particular process and background.

## Tools used so far:

### ~Tiny Pixel Fantasy Generator *by CazWolf* | Itch~ 05/10/2025

Lacked necessary variety, manual refinement, and organized sprite sheets. No flexibility in animation creation. It could serve as a visualization guide/conduit to manual creation of characters using other software.

### Pixel Lab AI | Web App 05/10/2025 (will refer to it in file names as *"PxL"*)

Using generative AI to generate text-to-image pixel-art characters and assets. Flexible in generation of animation, but requires extensive iterations of refinement and manual editing to produce consistent results. I will proceed with this workflow parallel to others.

### Blender + Mixamo + After Effects | Software/Web App 06/10/2025 (will refer to it in file names as *"Blx"*)

Using Blender to manually model a low-poly character, makes it easier to export animations in various directions and in an isometric orientation. This workflow is the most customizable, easily editable, but time-consuming and non-centralized. I will proceed with this workflow parallel to others.
